My program successfully performs all of the functions specified in the coursework specification without any errors. To run the program, just open menu.py and run it, and a tkinter window should open. The whole program is run through a GUI so the command line interface is not used apart from in some of the module tests.

If the book search function is being used, if you wish to search for more than one book, there is no need to click on the button again at the top, just change the name in the entry box and click search again. The same applies to both the book checkout and book return functions. If at any time the tkinter window gets full up, then just exit the window and re-run menu.py for a clear window.

Within the book checkout and book return I imported the ‘datetime’ module as it allows the program to automatically retrieve the date from the computer and the function adds it to the logfile.txt for the check in / check out dates. Also, within the logfile.txt I have only got the fields: bookID, checkout date, and check in date; which means that I had to implement a function in the booklist module to get the book name for each ID and then add up how many of each book has been withdrawn. A bubble sort is used to put the list in order of popularity and then a graph is plotted and embedded into the tkinter window. I also listed the books above the graph in popularity order so that it is easy to see the most popular books. Within the book checkout module, I included a try except statement so that the program wouldn’t error if an incorrect value is entered.
